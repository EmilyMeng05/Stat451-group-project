# Stat451-group-project
Hi! We are a group of students passionate about environmental issues. While exploring datasets from the
United Nations, the “Environment” section caught our eye, specifically the data on threatened species.
Understanding species loss can offer valuable insights into environmental history, reveal ongoing extinction
patterns, and identify specific groups (vertebrates, invertebrates, or plants) that may require more focused
conservation efforts. Since ecosystems are highly interconnected, examining trends in species loss may also
help us predict future impacts and highlight urgent actions needed to prevent further biodiversity decline.

We chose to analyze the threatened species dataset from the UN 'Environmental' section.

In our initial dataset analysis, we noticed a correlation between the number of species threatened and changes
over time. For this project, we aim to explore this further by investigating the question:
“How has the number of threatened species changed over time?”
In addition to this question, we have further sub-question to dive deeper into this topic:
"Which year was the total lost most extreme?"
"Which country lost the most vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants?"

**How has the number of threatened species changed over time?**

**Graph 1: bygroup_byyear_species.png**

In this visualization, it answers and shows how many of each type of endangered species over the years to see the change of the number of species over time. We have included "Vertebrate", "Invertebrate", "Plants", and "Total" to have a more comprehensive conclusion. Each type is represented as a different color line and is labeled as which line on the right. The total number of endangered species is also displayed as a black dashed line in order to provide an overall comparison. This graph uses line plots in order to easily show the increase or decrease of the number of endangered species over time. 

**Graph 2:Top 5 Countries_highest total amount.png**

From Graph 1, we have seen that in general, there's an increasing trend in the amount of threatened species we have. To find a solution to this issue, we need to consider specifically what causes this phenomenon, and geographical location is a big reason why. The goal of this visualization is to focus on the countries with the highest total numbers over time. By examining the top 5 countries with the largest totals, we can better understand how the amount of threatened species varies across different regions. The bar chart is ideal for this comparison, as it allows for a clear view of the differences in the total number of threatened species between countries. The x-axis represents the total number of species, while the y-axis displays the country names, with tick marks at the end of each bar showing the exact total for each country. This approach provides a straightforward way to highlight trends in the data and identify countries most impacted by the issue of threatened species.

**Graph 3: Top 5 country trend graph.png**

After identifying the top 5 countries with the highest total amounts of threatened species, this graph aims to visualize how the number of threatened species has changed over time for these countries. Each country is represented by a unique color to enhance readability and help distinguish between them. The legend, positioned on the right, organizes the countries in descending order, with Ecuador at the top, followed by Madagascar, and so on. The x-axis represents time, with spacing adjusted to show larger gaps between 2010-2015 and smaller gaps between 2020-2021, reflecting the varying intervals between these years. A multi-line graph is chosen for this visualization because it allows us to observe trends over time more clearly and facilitates comparisons between countries.

**Graph 4: Highest Lost of Life (top 5 countries for each category)**
With this visualization, I am answering the question: which country lost the most vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants? I separated the graphs for invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants into different graphs to make the information easier to understand. I also included the most total lost graph for completeness of analysis. From my graphs, I can see that the countries with the most lost vertebrates are Colombia, India, Indonesia, Madagascar, and Mexico. The countries with the most lost invertebrates are Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States. The countries with the most lost plants are Brazil, Ecuador, Madagascar, Malaysia, and Mexico. Finally, the countries with the most total lost of life is Ecuador, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, and the United States.
