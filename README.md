# Stat451-group-project
Hi! We are a group of students passionate about environmental issues. While exploring datasets from the
United Nations, the “Environment” section caught our eye, specifically the data on threatened species.
Understanding species loss can offer valuable insights into environmental history, reveal ongoing extinction
patterns, and identify specific groups (vertebrates, invertebrates, or plants) that may require more focused
conservation efforts. Since ecosystems are highly interconnected, examining trends in species loss may also
help us predict future impacts and highlight urgent actions needed to prevent further biodiversity decline.

We chose to analyze the threatened species dataset from the UN 'Environmental' section.

In our initial dataset analysis, we noticed a correlation between the number of species threatened and changes
over time. For this project, we aim to explore this further by investigating the question:
“How has the number of threatened species changed over time?”
In addition to this question, we have further sub-question to dive deeper into this topic:
"Which year was the total lost most extreme?"
"Which country lost the most vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants?"

**How has the number of threatened species changed over time?**
In this visualization, it answers and shows how many of each type of endangered species over the years to see the change of the number of species over time. Each type is represented as a different color line and is labeled as which line on the right. The total number of endangered species is also displayed as a black dashed line in order to provide an overall comparison. This graph uses line plots in order to easily show the increase or decrease of the number of endangered species over time.
