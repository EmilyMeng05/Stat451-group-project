# Stat451-group-project
Hi! We are a group of students passionate about environmental issues. While exploring datasets from the
United Nations, the “Environment” section caught our eye, specifically the data on threatened species.
Understanding species loss can offer valuable insights into environmental history, reveal ongoing extinction
patterns, and identify specific groups (vertebrates, invertebrates, or plants) that may require more focused
conservation efforts. Since ecosystems are highly interconnected, examining trends in species loss may also
help us predict future impacts and highlight urgent actions needed to prevent further biodiversity decline.

We chose to analyze the threatened species dataset from the UN 'Environmental' section.

In our initial dataset analysis, we noticed a correlation between the number of species threatened and changes
over time. For this project, we aim to explore this further by investigating the question:
“How has the number of threatened species changed over time?”
In addition to this question, we have further sub-question to dive deeper into this topic:
"Which year was the total lost most extreme?"
"Which country lost the most vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants?"
